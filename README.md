# Jobsite-scraping
Structured Data is a new concept for me and I’m still not sure about it. 

My current understanding is that only iimjobs didn’t support structured data. But I didn’t know how to scrap structured data content, so I used regular scraping for the 3 websites. I couldn’t scrape the iimjobs site, I have to learn more about scraping for that.  

I have attached a video of the scraping code working for internshala and talenttrack. 

I divided the content into task,company,description,begin date, duration and salary. The entries that didn’t have one of these had blank spaces appended. Don’t know what you meant by interesting and non interesting url.
